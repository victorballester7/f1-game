# Connect 4 game done in C using minimax algorithm

## Requirements

- `python`
- `ursina`

## Execution

Run the following commands in the terminal:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:victorballester7/connect4.git
cd connect4
make run
```

Or alternatively, if you don't have the SSH keys activated:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/victorballester7/connect4.git
cd connect4
make run
```

If you don't have `cmake` installed on your machine, you can substitute the last line with the following ones:

```sh
gcc -Wall -pedantic -std=c99 -o bin/main src/*.c -lncurses
./bin/main
```

> Attention! Because of the local path definition of some files, avoid executing the program from another folder rather than `connect4/` (for example, avoid executing it in `.../connect4/bin/`).
